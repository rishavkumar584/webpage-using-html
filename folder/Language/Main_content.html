<p>
It is always good to learn diffrent languages as it is the only medium 
through which we can share , express our fellings and thoughts with one
and another therefore a person having a good grip on languages can 
master the world or can convey his/her message to the other people in
the way he/she likes to convey it but whereas a person having a good knowldge
but is unable to represent himself / herself when required, which makes
him fell sad that after knowing so much i was unable to express what 
i wanted therefore language is also one of the most important thing
that one should have been mastered.

<p>

<strong>*</strong>Also the world has now been started to globalise which makes it important
to learn other languages in order to know about other country better.</p>
